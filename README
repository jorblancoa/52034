Simulation based on Fig. 6C of

Bush, PC and Prince, DA and Miller, KD (1999) Increased pyramidal excitability and 
nmda conductance can explain posttraumatic epileptogenesis without disinhibition: 
a model. Journal of Neurophysiology 82:1748-1758

After unzipping the archive and cd'ing to the directory:

To run under unix:  
        nrnivmodl; nrngui init.hoc
On the PC:
	While running mknrndll, cd to ctxnet and select make nrnmech.dll to compile
	the mod files in the ctxnet directory.
	Double click on mosinit.hoc in the ctxnet directory in window explorer
	
On the OS X mac:
	Drag the ctxnet folder to the mknrndll icon under the Neuron 5.7 application.
	When the above is complete drag the ctxnet folder to the nrngui icon.
	
Simulation shows epileptiform response to brief single stimulation in a 500 cell
network of multicompartment models, some of which have active dendrites.

The simulation depends on random number generation so will likely run differently
under different operating systems.  The results which I obtained under Redhat
Linux is shown in result.gif.  The current version can have a couple of lines 
uncommented in holt_random.mod (see comments) to have the seed change each 
time the simulation is run.

Original 1997 code from Paul Bush modified slightly by Bill Lytton to make it work with
current version of NEURON (5.7.139).  Thanks to Paul Bush and Ken Miller for
making the code available.
